#🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Lifestyle Prediction Model
🔍 Overview
This project is part of NEXUS’25 - DIGITAL VJTI (INNOVIZE Round 1). The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts whether an individual is healthy or not based on their physical fitness, diet, activity level, sleep habits, mindfulness, and career choices.

We used Random Forest and SVM models to classify individuals as healthy (1) or unhealthy (0) and visualized decision boundaries for analysis.

📂 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of 6,000 entries, with attributes:

phy_fitness (Physical Fitness Level)
diet_preferences
activity_level
sleep_habits
mindfulness
career
Target Variable: is_healthy (1 = Healthy, 0 = Unhealthy)

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ Python
✅ Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
✅ Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)
✅ Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
✅ Flask (API Deployment)
✅ Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📊 Model Training & Performance
We trained and tested two ML models:

Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
📌 Final Accuracy Scores:
✅ Random Forest Classifier – Accuracy: 92.88%
✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Accuracy: 92.29%
